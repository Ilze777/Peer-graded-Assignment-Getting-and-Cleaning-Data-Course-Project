Author: Ilze777

This repository has been created as per the requirements of the Coursera-Johns Hopkins University course: Getting and Cleaning Data

##Objective

Collect, work with and clean a dataset. The goal is to collect dataset that can be used later on for further Analysis.

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository

##Content

CodeBook.md lists the question instrcuctions, describes the variables in use.

Run_Analysis.R contains the code needed to clean and tidy the dataset as per the instructions outlined in the codebook.




The outline of analysis performed is to:
Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names
From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
tidy.txt is the output of the final step.
